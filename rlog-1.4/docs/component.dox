/*! @page component RLog Components

An RLog Component is typically a group of files with some shared purpose.  

When programs are built with RLog, the value of RLOG_COMPONENT is used as the
component name.  If RLOG_COMPONENT is not set at compile time, you may receive
a compiler warning, and the component will be set to "[unknown]".

For example when rlog is built, it specifies @b -DRLOG_COMPONENT="rlog".

For more detail on how to use components in subscriptions, see @ref channel.
